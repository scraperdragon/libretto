Sending data to backdrop
========================

So you have a bucket and an access token, how do you actually get your data into backdrop?

By HTTP API
-----------
Backdrop exposes a very small HTTP API for pushing data in. There is one endpoint per bucket that can accept one or more JSON records being sent to it vi a POST. You authorize each request by adding an Authorization header with the secret access token you should have been provided for each bucket.

In summary:

- The URL should be `https://<backdrop-write-host>/<bucket-name>`, where `backdrop-write-host` is eg `www.preview.performance.service.gov.uk`
- The content and content type must be JSON.
- There must be a valid Authorization header.

The .. _backdropsend: https://github.com/alphagov/backdropsend tool provides a command line interface to the API.

See the example below using curl (all examples using curl 7.24)::

  curl -X POST -d '{"name":"Jane"}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>' -H 'Content-type: application/json' 'http://<backdrop-write-host>/<bucket-name>'

Often you'll need to send multiple records to backdrop at once. You can do this by sending an array of records::

  curl -X POST -d '[{"name":"Jane"},{"name":"John"}]' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>' -H 'Content-type: application/json' 'http://<backdrop-write-host>/<bucket-name>'

.. warning:: When reading back data you've pushed to the platform, beware of server-side caching. It's advisable to develop against a local instance of the platform with no caching to ensure the data you're seeing is up-to-date.

By uploading a file
-------------------

Backdrop also accepts file uploads through its admin interface. Log on with your signon account and you will be presented with a list of buckets you can upload to. Upload files should be in CSV or Excel (depending what has been configured for your bucket). The first row must contain the field names and each subsequent line is values for a single record. The same rules around field names and special fields apply as for the JSON API (see below).

What is a record?
-----------------

A record is a flat (not nested) JSON object with zero or more attributes that can be saved into backdrop and aggregated on at a later stage. In order to be a valid record it must comply to some rules.

Valid field names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All record field names:

- must start with a letter
- must be alphanumeric
- may contain underscores
- some special field names start with an underscore

.. note::

  {"name": "Jane", "home_town": "Godalming"}

.. warning::

  {"name": "Jane", "home town": "Godalming"} # Spaces are not allowed

  {"_name": "Jane", "home_town": "Godalming"} # Underscore prefix is reserved

  {"1_name": "Jane", "2_home_town": "Godalming"} # The first character must be a letter


Special fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backdrop understands some special field names that it will treat in specific ways.

The `_id` field
+++++++++++++++

The `_id` field is a unique identifier (or primary key) for the record. You can use this if you are going to want to update records or prevent defaults. When sending a record to backdrop if a record with the provided `_id` already exists in the bucket it will be overwriten.

The `_id` field:

- must be a string
- must not contain spaces
- must not be empty

The `_timestamp` field
++++++++++++++++++++++

The `_timestamp` field is the central field when working with time series data. It represents the time stamp of a record. It allows you to query by time ranges and aggregate by predefined time periods (ie. week, month).

The `_timestamp` field:

- must be a string
- must be of the form (`2013-12-31T00:00:00+00:00`)

.. note::

  Atom says some nice stuff about date formats - we should take a look at that.
